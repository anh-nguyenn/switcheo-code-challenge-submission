## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Anh Nguyen, a third-year student majoring in Information Engineering and Media at Nanyang Technological University. My areas of interest are software development and product management. I chose to apply to Switcheo largely because of the mentorship environment, which comes highly recommended by a friend who previously interned here. I am eager to contribute to meaningful real-world projects and find fresh motivation.
